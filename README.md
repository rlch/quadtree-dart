# Quadtree

A lightweight quadtree implementation written in Dart.

## Installing

Run this command:

```bash
> flutter pub add quadtree_dart
```

## Motivation

I plan on building a force-directed-graph library in Dart that will use `quadtree_dart` to reduce the order complexity of force calculations from `O(n^2)` to `O(nlog(n))`.

## Example

See `example/` for a fleshed-out example with tunable parameters.

You can see it live on [rjmath-quadtree.web.app](https://rjmath-quadtree.web.app/#/) :tada:

## Contribution
